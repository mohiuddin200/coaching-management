## 1\. Project Overview & Purpose

- **Primary Goal:** Develop a scalable SaaS platform to manage coaching institutes, enabling efficient handling of student profiles, class schedules, attendance (with optional biometric integration), payment collection, and marketing outreach. The system prioritizes user role-based access control (RBAC), data privacy, and real-time functionality.
- **Business Domain:** The application serves educational coaching institutes, streamlining operations such as student management, attendance tracking, financial transactions, and targeted marketing to parents. Key features include biometric-based attendance with optional SMS notifications and a marketing module for retargeting prospective clients.
- **Key Features**:

  - **Student Profiles**: Manage student details, including batch, schedule, parent_phone, and class enrollments.
  - **Accounts**: Handle payment collection and expense tracking (to be detailed in later phases).
  - **Attendance**: Optional biometric-based attendance system with fingerprint machines, sending real-time SMS notifications to parents (opt-in feature with usage-based pricing).
  - **Exam Module**: Placeholder for generating exam-related functionality (to be defined later).
  - **Marketing Module**: Store and manage parent contact details for periodic retargeting with batch updates.

### Challenges

- **Biometric Integration**: Interfacing with various fingerprint devices, handling API inconsistencies, and ensuring offline sync capabilities.

## 3\. Architectural Patterns

- **Overall Architecture**: Full-stack application with a type-safe, modular design.

  - **Frontend**: Next.js application using App Router for admin and user-facing interfaces.
  - **Backend**: REST API with Prisma for database operations, integrated with biometric devices and SMS providers.
  - **Real-time**: WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for live attendance updates and notifications.

- **Directory Structure Philosophy**:

  - /app: Contains Next.js routes for admin and user-facing interfaces.
  - /lib: Shared utilities, API clients, and backend logic.
  - /components: Shared UI components based on shadcn/ui.
  - /prisma: Database schema and migrations.

- **Database Schema** (Preliminary):

  - **Users**: id, email, role (Admin, Teacher, Student, Staff), first_name, last_name, phone_number, parent_phone, sms_enabled, timestamps
  - **Classes**: id, name, schedule_time, teacher_id, capacity, status, timestamps
  - **Enrollments**: id, user_id, class_id, enrollment_date, status, timestamps
  - **Attendance**: id, user_id, class_id, timestamp, entry_type (Entry/Exit), device_id, timestamps
  - **BiometricDevices**: id, name, api_endpoint, api_key, status, timestamps
  - **SmsLogs**: id, recipient_phone, message_content, status, cost, timestamps
  - **MarketingContacts**: id, parent_name, phone_number, query_details, last_contacted, timestamps

## 4\. Coding Conventions & Style Guide

- **Formatting**: Use prettier for consistent code formatting, enforced via format script in package.json.
- **Naming Conventions**:

  - Variables, functions, database fields: camelCase (e.g., studentProfile, sendSmsNotification)
  - React Components: PascalCase (e.g., StudentProfileCard)
  - Files: kebab-case (e.g., student-profile.tsx)

- **API Design**: Use Next.js API routes for type-safe endpoints. Backend functions should be modular and reusable.
- **Error Handling**: Implement Sentry for error monitoring. Use try...catch for async operations and validate inputs with zod.
- **Biometric Integration**: Standardize API calls to fingerprint devices using a middleware layer to handle vendor-specific protocols.
- **SMS Notifications**: Use event-driven architecture with a queue (e.g., Redis) to manage high-volume SMS sending.

## 5\. Key Files & Entrypoints

- **Main Entrypoints**:

  - App: app/layout.tsx, app/page.tsx
  - Backend Logic: app/api/ (for API routes)
  - Database Schema: prisma/schema.prisma

- **Configuration**:

  - App: next.config.mjs
  - Database: prisma/schema.prisma
  - Tooling: .eslintrc.js, tsconfig.json

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: To be defined (e.g., GitHub Actions in .github/workflows). Include linting, testing, and deployment steps.

## 6\. Development & Testing Workflow

- npm run devRuns Next.js dev server, Supabase local database, and any real-time services.
- npm run buildBuilds the app for production.
- **Testing**: Establish a testing framework (e.g., Jest or Vitest). Write unit tests for backend logic (e.g., attendance processing) and integration tests for biometric and SMS APIs.
- **Biometric Integration Workflow**:

  1.  Mock biometric device APIs for local testing.
  2.  Use environment variables for API keys and endpoints.
  3.  Implement offline queuing for attendance data sync.

- **SMS Integration Workflow**:

  1.  Use Twilio or equivalent SDK for SMS sending.
  2.  Log all SMS attempts and costs in SmsLogs table.
  3.  Implement rate-limiting and retry logic for failed sends.

## 7\. Specific Instructions for AI Collaboration

- **Contribution Guidelines**: Create feature branches and submit pull requests. Follow Conventional Commits (e.g., feat: add biometric integration, fix: resolve SMS queue issue).
- \# Add a librarynpm install zod# Add a dev dependencynpm install --save-dev prisma
- **Backend Modifications**:

  1.  Update prisma/schema.prisma for database changes.
  2.  Run npx prisma db push to sync schema with Supabase.
  3.  Update API routes in app/api/.

- npx shadcn-ui@latest add buttonAdds components to the components directory.
- **Biometric Integration**:

  - Use a middleware layer to normalize API responses from different fingerprint devices.
  - Store device metadata in BiometricDevices table.
  - Handle errors gracefully with fallbacks (e.g., manual attendance entry).

- **SMS Notifications**:

  - Use Redis for queuing high-volume SMS tasks.
  - Log costs and statuses for billing transparency.
  - Allow institutes to toggle SMS features via NotificationPreferences.

## 8\. Agent Directives: Shell Command Execution Policy

### High-Volume Command Filtering

To conserve tokens and reduce latency for commands with large outputs (e.g., build logs, test runs):

1.  npm run build > /tmp/build_output.txt 2>&1
2.  **NEVER** include raw output in chat context.
3.  **CONDITIONAL READING**: Read the output file only if the command returns a non-zero exit code.
4.  If the exit code is 0, respond with: "Command successful: \[Brief summary of command intent\]."
5.  If non-zero, read /tmp/build_output.txt and propose a fix based on the log.

## Additional Notes for AI Collaboration

- **Biometric Integration Challenges**:

  - **Vendor Variability**: Different fingerprint devices have proprietary APIs. Use a middleware layer to abstract these differences, mapping responses to a standard format.
  - **Offline Sync**: Implement a local queue (e.g., IndexedDB or Redis) to store attendance data during network issues, syncing when connectivity is restored.
  - **Security**: Encrypt biometric data in transit and at rest, ensuring compliance with data protection laws.
  - **Suggestions**: Consider SDKs like ZKTeco or Suprema for common fingerprint devices, and test with mock APIs during development.

- **Exam Module Suggestions**:

  - Generate exam schedules based on class enrollments.
  - Allow teachers to upload question banks and auto-generate randomized tests.
  - Provide student performance reports with export options (PDF/Excel).

- **Marketing Module**:

  - Store parent contact details in MarketingContacts table.
  - Implement a cron job to send periodic SMS/email campaigns with batch updates.
  - Use analytics to track campaign engagement (e.g., open rates, conversions).

- **Next Steps**:

  - Clarify requirements for the exam module to prioritize features.
  - Define payment collection and expense tracking workflows for the accounts feature.
  - Evaluate scaling needs for PostgreSQL and Supabase usage.

# 9. Agent Directives: Shell Command Execution Policy

## High-Volume Command Filtering

To conserve tokens and reduce latency, when executing any shell command that may produce large output (e.g., test runners, build logs, verbose commands, or long scripts):

1.  **ALWAYS** redirect standard output and standard error to a file in the temporary directory (e.g., `pnpm run test > output.txt 2>&1`).
2.  **NEVER** allow the raw, unpiped output to enter the chat context.
3.  **CONDITIONAL READING:** You must only read the content of the file if the command returns a **non-zero exit code**.
4.  If the exit code is **zero (0)**, simply state: "Command successful" and provide a brief, one-sentence summary of the command's intent.
5.  If the exit code is **non-zero (>0)**, read the contents of the file and use that specific log data to propose a fix.
