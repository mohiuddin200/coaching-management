# Class Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete class management system for a school-level coaching institution (Class 1-10) has been implemented. The system supports levels, subjects, class sections, teacher assignments, scheduling, and automatic student enrollment.

## Architecture

### Database Structure

#### New Models Added:
1. **Level** - Represents class levels (1-10)
   - Fields: id, name, levelNumber, description, status
   - Relations: Has many subjects and students

2. **Subject** - Academic subjects for each level
   - Fields: id, name, code, description, levelId, status
   - Relations: Belongs to Level, has many ClassSections
   - Unique constraint: (levelId, name)

3. **ClassSection** - Actual teaching groups (main entity)
   - Fields: id, name, subjectId, teacherId, capacity, roomNumber, academicYear, status
   - Relations: Belongs to Subject and Teacher, has many Schedules, Enrollments, and Attendances

4. **Schedule** - Time slots for class sections
   - Fields: id, classSectionId, dayOfWeek, startTime, endTime, status
   - Relations: Belongs to ClassSection

#### Modified Models:
- **Student**: Added `levelId` field to assign students to a class level
- **Enrollment**: Added `classSectionId` field (keeping `classId` for backward compatibility)
- **Attendance**: Added `classSectionId` field (keeping `classId` for backward compatibility)
- **Teacher**: Added `classSections` relation

## Features Implemented

### 1. Level Management
- **Initialize Levels**: One-click setup of Class 1-10
- **View Levels**: Display all levels with student and subject counts
- **Status Management**: Active/Inactive levels

### 2. Subject Management
- **Create Subjects**: Add subjects to specific levels
- **Subject Details**: Name, code, description
- **View Subjects**: See subjects grouped by level with class section counts

### 3. Class Section Management (Core Feature)
- **Create Class Sections**: 
  - Select level and subject (cascading)
  - Assign teacher
  - Set capacity and room number
  - Define academic year
  - Add multiple schedules (day, start time, end time)
- **View Class Sections**:
  - Grouped by level
  - Shows teacher, enrollment count, capacity
  - Displays schedules
  - Status badges
- **Filter Options**: By level, subject, or teacher

### 4. Student Enrollment
- **Level Selection**: Students can be assigned to a level during creation
- **Auto-Enrollment**: When a student is assigned to a level, they are automatically enrolled in ALL class sections for that level
- **Enrollment Tracking**: View enrollment counts per class section

## API Endpoints Created

### Levels
- `GET /api/levels` - Get all levels with counts
- `POST /api/levels` - Create a new level
- `GET /api/levels/[id]` - Get specific level with details
- `PATCH /api/levels/[id]` - Update a level
- `DELETE /api/levels/[id]` - Delete a level
- `POST /api/levels/initialize` - Initialize default 10 levels

### Subjects
- `GET /api/subjects?levelId={id}` - Get subjects (optionally filter by level)
- `POST /api/subjects` - Create a new subject
- `GET /api/subjects/[id]` - Get specific subject with class sections
- `PATCH /api/subjects/[id]` - Update a subject
- `DELETE /api/subjects/[id]` - Delete a subject

### Class Sections
- `GET /api/class-sections?levelId={id}&subjectId={id}&teacherId={id}` - Get class sections (with filters)
- `POST /api/class-sections` - Create class section with schedules
- `GET /api/class-sections/[id]` - Get specific section with enrollments
- `PATCH /api/class-sections/[id]` - Update a class section
- `DELETE /api/class-sections/[id]` - Delete a class section
- `POST /api/class-sections/[id]/schedules` - Add schedule to section
- `DELETE /api/class-sections/[id]/schedules?scheduleId={id}` - Delete schedule

### Students (Modified)
- `GET /api/students` - Now includes level information
- `POST /api/students` - Now accepts levelId and auto-enrolls in class sections

## UI Pages

### 1. Levels & Subjects Page (`/levels`)
- Split-view interface
- Left: List of all 10 class levels with counts
- Right: Subjects for selected level
- Quick subject creation dialog
- Initialize levels button (if not set up)

### 2. Class Sections Page (`/classes`)
- Main management page
- Create class section dialog with:
  - Level and subject cascading selectors
  - Teacher dropdown
  - Capacity and room number fields
  - Academic year input
  - Dynamic schedule builder (add/remove schedules)
- View class sections grouped by level
- Cards showing:
  - Section name and status
  - Subject
  - Teacher name
  - Enrollment/capacity
  - All schedules
  - Room number

### 3. Student Form (Modified)
- Added "Class Level" dropdown
- Fetches levels from API
- Optional field
- When selected, student is auto-enrolled in all sections

## Navigation Updates
- Added "Levels & Subjects" menu item under Classes
- Renamed "All Classes" to "Class Sections"

## Workflow

### Setting Up the System:
1. **Initialize Levels**: Click "Initialize Levels" button to create Class 1-10
2. **Add Subjects**: For each level, add relevant subjects (Math, English, Science, etc.)
3. **Create Class Sections**: 
   - Select level and subject
   - Assign teacher
   - Set schedules
4. **Add Students**: Create students and assign them to a level (auto-enrolled in all sections)

### Day-to-Day Usage:
1. Teachers view their assigned class sections
2. Students are automatically enrolled in all subjects of their level
3. Attendance is tracked per class section
4. Schedules are visible for each section

## Migration Applied
- Migration: `20251031200449_add_class_management_structure`
- Added: Level, Subject, ClassSection, Schedule models
- Modified: Student, Enrollment, Attendance, Teacher models
- Backward compatible with existing Class model

## Key Design Decisions

### Why This Structure?
1. **Level + Subject = ClassSection**: Clear hierarchy matching school structure
2. **Auto-enrollment**: Simplifies onboarding, students get all subjects automatically
3. **Multiple Schedules**: Flexible scheduling (e.g., Monday 9-10, Wednesday 2-3)
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Old Class model retained for migration safety

### MVP Simplifications:
- No manual enrollment/unenrollment (happens automatically)
- Single teacher per class section
- Simple schedule format (day + time)
- No room conflict detection (future enhancement)
- No capacity enforcement (future enhancement)

## Future Enhancements
1. Manual enrollment management
2. Multiple teachers per section (co-teaching)
3. Room availability checking
4. Schedule conflict detection
5. Capacity limits and waitlists
6. Academic year archiving
7. Class section cloning
8. Bulk operations

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Initialize levels (creates 10 levels)
- [ ] Add subjects to multiple levels
- [ ] Create class section with schedules
- [ ] Create student with level assigned
- [ ] Verify auto-enrollment in class sections
- [ ] View class sections grouped by level
- [ ] Update class section details
- [ ] Add/remove schedules

## Notes
- All timestamps use DateTime fields
- Status fields use enums (Active/Inactive for most models)
- Cascade delete enabled for related data
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Form validation with Zod schemas
- Responsive UI design with shadcn/ui components
